title: "Step 6: Produce a structured report"
---

> **Time:** 10 minutes

## What you'll produce

You'll produce a concise report that separates page evidence, criterion mapping, remediation, and
the limits of the review.

## Separate evidence from interpretation

An agent response contains **evidence** and **interpretation**. Evidence is what Playwright
observed, such as an input with no accessible name. Interpretation is the criterion mapping and
remediation based on that evidence and the catalog result.

A clear output contract tells the agent what to include, what to leave out, and how to handle
uncertainty. It makes reports more consistent without claiming that the review is exhaustive.

## Be useful without overstating the result

One automated snapshot cannot establish accessibility conformance. The report should stick to
high-confidence findings without invented statistics, decorative severity labels, or a broad claim
that the page passes or fails WCAG.

The agent now turns `browser evidence + catalog result` into a bounded, repeatable report.

## Give the report a contract

### 1. Add the report contract

Create `workshop-app/Helpers/Prompts.cs`:

```csharp
namespace HelloCopilotSDK.Helpers;

public static class Prompts
{
    public static string CreateReportPrompt(Uri targetUri) => $"""
        Prepare an evidence-based accessibility review of {targetUri.AbsoluteUri}.

        1. Use browser_navigate to open that exact URL.
        2. Call read_latest_accessibility_snapshot to inspect its accessibility tree.
        3. Identify three to five high-confidence issues supported by the snapshot.
        4. Call accessibility_rule_lookup for each issue before recommending a fix.

        Return only this structure:

        # Accessibility review
        ## Finding 1: <short name>
        - Evidence: <specific element or page structure observed in the browser>
        - WCAG criterion: <criterion and title returned by the catalog>
        - Recommended remediation: <specific implementation change>

        Repeat the finding section as needed.

        ## Review limits
        State that this is a focused review of browser-observable evidence, not a full WCAG conformance audit.

        Do not invent evidence, report unsupported statistics, or claim the page is WCAG compliant.
        """;
}
```

### 2. Use the contract

Replace the final send call in `Program.cs`:

```csharp
Console.WriteLine($"\nAnalyzing: {targetUri.AbsoluteUri}\n");
await ResponseStreamer.SendAndPrintAsync(session, Prompts.CreateReportPrompt(targetUri));
```

## Run it

```bash
dotnet run --project workshop-app
```

When the app asks for a URL, paste:

```text
https://jamesmontemagno.github.io/workshop-accessibility-agent/target-app/
```

The report should follow this shape:

```text
# Accessibility review
## Finding 1: Input has no accessible name
- Evidence: The snapshot contains a textbox with no accessible name.
- WCAG criterion: 4.1.2 Name, Role, Value
- Recommended remediation: Associate a visible label using matching for and id values.

## Review limits
This focused review uses browser-observable evidence and is not a full WCAG conformance audit.
```

<details>
<summary>Troubleshooting this run</summary>

| Symptom | Fix |
|---|---|
| The output contains unsupported counts | Confirm the prompt says not to report unsupported statistics. |
| A finding has no concrete element or structure | Treat it as ungrounded; keep the evidence requirement in the report contract. |
| The response claims WCAG compliance | Keep the required **Review limits** section and explicit prohibition. |

</details>

> **You're ready for the final run when:** each finding contains specific browser evidence, a
> catalog criterion, and a remediation, and the report ends with its limits.

## Check your understanding

In the report, which content is direct evidence and which content is model interpretation?

<details>
<summary>Check your answer</summary>

The element or page structure returned by Playwright is evidence. Choosing the criterion and
writing the remediation are interpretations based on that evidence and the catalog result.

    targetUri.Scheme is not ("http" or "https"))
{
    Console.Error.WriteLine("Enter an absolute HTTP or HTTPS URL.");
    return;
}

await using var client = new CopilotClient();
await client.StartAsync();

var ping = await client.PingAsync("workshop");
Console.WriteLine($"\nConnected to the Copilot runtime: {ping.Message}\n");

var selectedModel = await ModelSelector.SelectAsync(client);

var workingDirectory = Directory.GetCurrentDirectory();

await using var session = await client.CreateSessionAsync(new SessionConfig
{
    Model = selectedModel,
    Streaming = true,
    OnPermissionRequest = WorkshopPermissionHandler.CreateForTarget(targetUri),
    Tools =
    [
        AccessibilityRuleCatalog.CreateLookupTool(),
        PlaywrightSnapshotReader.CreateTool(workingDirectory)
    ],
    AvailableTools =
    [
        "accessibility_rule_lookup",
        "read_latest_accessibility_snapshot",
        "playwright-browser_navigate"
    ],
    McpServers = new Dictionary<string, McpServerConfig>
    {
        ["playwright"] = new McpStdioServerConfig
        {
            Command = "npx",
            Args = ["-y", "@playwright/mcp@0.0.78", "--browser=msedge"],
            WorkingDirectory = workingDirectory,
            Tools = ["browser_navigate"]
        }
    }
});

Console.WriteLine($"Analyzing: {targetUri.AbsoluteUri}\n");
