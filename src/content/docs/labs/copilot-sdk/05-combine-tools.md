title: "Step 5: Combine local and MCP tools"

> **Time:** 15 minutes

## What you'll orchestrate

You'll use one URL to drive an agent turn that gathers browser evidence with Playwright and gets
remediation guidance from the local WCAG catalog.

## Let the agent choose the right tool

**Agent orchestration** is the model choosing and sequencing capabilities to complete a goal. Your
session exposes two different tools through one interface:

- Playwright discovers facts about the live page.
- The C# catalog explains a matching criterion and remediation.

Both tools report through `ToolExecutionStartEvent` and `ToolExecutionCompleteEvent`. Your
application can observe the work without knowing how either tool is implemented.

## Keep evidence and guidance in their lanes

Each tool has one job. Playwright supplies browser evidence, while the local catalog supplies
the application's source-of-truth guidance. The answer is grounded in those sources instead of
asking the model to infer both.

The flow is now `URL -> Playwright evidence -> WCAG catalog lookup -> grounded response`.

## Put both tools to work

### 1. Read and validate a URL

Remove the command-line argument validation from Step 4. After the banner and before creating the
client, insert:

```csharp
Console.Write("Enter URL to analyze: ");
var urlInput = Console.ReadLine()?.Trim();

if (string.IsNullOrWhiteSpace(urlInput))
{
    Console.Error.WriteLine("Enter a URL to analyze.");
    return;
}

if (!urlInput.Contains("://", StringComparison.Ordinal))
{
    urlInput = $"https://{urlInput}";
}

if (!Uri.TryCreate(urlInput, UriKind.Absolute, out var targetUri) ||
    targetUri.Scheme is not ("http" or "https"))
{
    Console.Error.WriteLine("Enter an absolute HTTP or HTTPS URL.");
    return;
}
```

The Step 4 handler receives this validated `targetUri`, so the URL boundary still applies.

### 2. Give the agent a three-tool goal

Replace the final prompt:

```csharp
Console.WriteLine($"\nAnalyzing: {targetUri.AbsoluteUri}\n");
await ResponseStreamer.SendAndPrintAsync(
    session,
    $"""
    Use browser_navigate to open {targetUri.AbsoluteUri}, then call read_latest_accessibility_snapshot.
    Identify two high-confidence accessibility issues supported by the snapshot.
    For each issue, call accessibility_rule_lookup and return:
    - the browser evidence;
    - the matching criterion;
    - the catalog's recommended remediation.
    """);
```

The prompt assigns evidence and guidance to their correct sources. It leaves the order of the
catalog lookups to the agent.

## Run it

```bash
dotnet run --project workshop-app
```

Paste this URL when prompted:

```text
https://jamesmontemagno.github.io/workshop-accessibility-agent/target-app/
```

You should see activity from both kinds of tool:

```text
[tool:start] playwright-browser_navigate
[tool:start] read_latest_accessibility_snapshot
[tool:start] accessibility_rule_lookup

- Evidence: The text input has no accessible name ...
- WCAG criterion: 4.1.2 Name, Role, Value
- Recommended remediation: Associate a visible <label> ...
```

The exact order and wording can vary. The evidence must come from Playwright, and the criterion
must match the catalog.

<details>
<summary>Troubleshooting this run</summary>

| Symptom | Fix |
|---|---|
| Only Playwright tools run | Keep the explicit instruction to call `accessibility_rule_lookup` for each issue. |
| The catalog tool runs before browser inspection | This can be valid planning, but reject any final finding that lacks browser evidence. |
| The URL is rejected | Enter an HTTP or HTTPS URL; a missing scheme is automatically changed to `https://`. |

</details>

> **You're ready to shape the report when:** one run names a Playwright tool and
> `accessibility_rule_lookup`, then connects browser evidence to catalog guidance.

## Check your understanding

Which tool should discover an input without an accessible name, and which tool should explain the
associated WCAG criterion?

<details>
<summary>Check your answer</summary>

Playwright finds the input on the live page. The local catalog returns the application's
source-of-truth criterion and remediation.
