title: "Part 5: Polish & Parallel Work"
---

Now that the app works and looks great, it's time to polish. This part is about splitting work up so you can improve responsiveness, error handling, and quality without doing everything in a single serial loop.




## Task 1: Split the Work with `/fleet`

In Copilot CLI, use `/fleet` to split the work across parallel subagents, then review the combined output:

```text
/fleet Improve the app in parallel:
1. Add responsive CSS media queries so the comparison collapses to one column at 1024px and the inputs stack on small screens.
2. Improve keyboard accessibility and focus visibility.
3. Improve the error experience with stronger validation feedback and arcade-style neon error states.
```

Let the CLI orchestrate the work, then inspect the combined result with `/diff` before approving anything.

## Task 2: Delegate a Variation (Optional)

If you want to try an asynchronous cloud workflow, delegate a design variation:

```text
/delegate Create an alternative color theme for the battle page that keeps the retro arcade look but swaps in blue (#00f5ff) and orange (#ff6b35). Make it easy to toggle.
```

That delegated task should create a pull request you can review separately while you keep working locally.

> [!NOTE]
> `/delegate` needs a repository where you can create issues and pull requests. Fork `workshop-mona-mayhem` before this optional task. If you cannot fork it, skip this task and continue with the local review exercises.

## Task 3: Run an Agentic Review

Before you wrap up, ask Copilot CLI for a review pass:

```text
/review Focus on potential bugs, accessibility issues, and UX regressions in the current branch.
```

For extra quality gates, run the other built-in review agents too:

```text
/rubber-duck Critique my battle logic and error handling for edge cases I may have missed.
```

> 📝 The rubber duck agent is currently only available if the main agent is using a Claude or GPT large language model.

```text
/security-review
```

Review the findings, fix anything you agree with, then run `/diff` again so you're clear on what changed.

> 💡 `/review`, `/rubber-duck`, and `/security-review` are all **built-in agents** — you'll learn to build your *own* specialized agents in Part 6.

## Task 4: Verify Everything


> **⚠️ Not seeing changes?** If any of the polish updates aren't showing up, stop the dev server (`Ctrl+C`) and restart with `npm run dev`, then do a hard refresh (`Ctrl+Shift+R`) in your browser.

Run through these test scenarios to make sure everything works:

| Test | Expected Result |
|------|----------------|
| Empty fields, click Battle | Styled error with shake animation |
| Valid usernames | Contribution graphs displayed |
| Invalid username | Error from API with retro styling |
| Enter key in input | Triggers battle |
| Mobile width | Single-column responsive layout |
| Hover contribution squares | Tooltip with date and count |

Build for production and confirm there are no errors:

```bash
npm run build && npm run preview
```

Once everything looks good, commit your working code.

## ✅ Part 5 Complete!

**What you learned:**

- Break polish work into **smaller parallel tasks**
- Review generated changes before merging them into your main branch
- Use Copilot for **quality passes and optional explorations**, not just implementation
